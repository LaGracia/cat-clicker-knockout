## Description

This is a Udacity minicourse project for JavaScript Design Patterns. It revises the previous Cat Clicker app by using the Knockout JS library.

### Project details

The [page](http://lagracia.github.io/cat-clicker-knockout/) features a list of cats and an area to display one selected cat. Users choose a cat by clicking on the button showing its name. An image of the selected cat, its name, its score, and its level shows up in the display area.

The score for the chosen cat increases every time the user clicks on its image, and the level changes based on the current number of clicks. When a second cat is chosen, the score for the first cat does not reset. It will continue from where it left off when the user clicks on the first cat again.

### Credits

Unlike most (if not all) of my Udacity projects, this one actually owes its success to the excellent videos, which give clear instructions for how to proceed at every stage, so I never had to consult the forum at all. Props also go to the Knockout team for their library and the readable documentation that comes with it.

P.S. This time all images, copyrighted or not, are attributed to their sources.
